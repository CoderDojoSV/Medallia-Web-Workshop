#Medallia Web Workshop

Today we will be learning to make websites using HTML and CSS. No previous experience is necessary, just have fun and be creative! We will be making web pages to help us tell a story that we can show our friends and family.


###Setup
Please create an account at [http://jsbin.com/](http://jsbin.com/). You will need an account in order to save your web page you create today. If you are under 13, grab your parent to help.


###What is HTML?
A web page is made up of many HTML elements, called tags, that are enclosed in angle brackets. These tags tell your web computer what to show.

The paragraph below is an example of how you mark a paragraph in HTML, by surrounding it in opening and closing `<p>` tags.

```html
<p>All web pages on the internet use HTML!</p>
```

###Example - A Web Page About My Favorite Season

This bit of code:

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>My Favorite Season</h1>
   <p>Today, I'd like to share about my favorite season.</p>
   <p>There are four seasons in a year.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>spring</li>
    <li>summer</li>
    <li>fall</li>
    <li>winter</li>
   </ul>
   <p>My favorite season is summer, because I can go to the beach with my family.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```

Will produce a web page that looks like this:

###Your Story - What's Your Super Power?
Our projects today will be about your imaginary super powers. It will be a whole web page around "if I had a super power, it would be ..."

What would you use your super power for? Does any one have this power? Are there any downsides?

Be creative! Invisibility, flight, speed, and more!
